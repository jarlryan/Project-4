# Project-4
This program implements functions to receive an input file (mp4romanletrdata.txt) that contains data 
consisting of a series randomly placed roman numerals and math operators, outputing roman numerals
with their standard numeric conversions, and calculates the standard numeric result using the 
operator given on each line, with conversions back to roman numerals.
